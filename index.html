                    <div class="text"><p>Can our best minds – in urban planning, civil engineering, computer technology, sociology and other
    fields – find solutions? “We just can’t afford to say no”, says <a target="" href="http://www.sciencesquared.eu/network/researcher/debra.laefer">Debra Laefer,</a> associate professor 
    in the School of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering at University College Dublin.
    “We’re going to get two billion more people on the planet between now and 2050. And we know
    two-thirds of them are going to want to live in cities.”</p>

<p><a target="" href="http://www.sciencesquared.eu/network/researcher/ludovic.leclercq">Ludovic Leclerq</a>, Research Director at The French Institute of Science and Technology in Transport,
    Planning and Networks agrees. “My idea is to provide tools for people to think of new ways of 
    managing cities,” he says.</p>

<p>Leclerq and Laefer are among scores of scientists now applying their in-depth subject 
    expertise to urban research projects funded by the European Research Council, one of
    Europe’s biggest frontier-research funders. Laefer has developed a new technique for
    aerial mapping of heritage buildings to help in avoiding damage when tunnelling below 
    them for underground transport systems. Leclerq is laying the foundations for next-generation 
    road traffic management systems that anticipate congestion, rather than reacting to it.</p>

<p>Other ERC-funded researchers are studying how nature builds ecosystems in a diminishing number
    of green spaces, new ways of modelling cities, and how, in addition to being a source of annoyance,
    traffic noise actually damages our health. This is blue-sky stuff; it won’t get the refuse collected 
    in your neighbourhood tomorrow. But like all frontier research, it will eventually transform our lives 
    – in this case, what it’s like to live in a big city. </p></div>

                    <div class="text"> <p><a href="http://www.sciencesquared.eu/network/researcher/rob.kitchin" target="">Rob Kitchin</a>, a professor in the National Institute of Regional and Spatial Analysis at    Maynooth University, &nbsp;Ireland, &nbsp;and another ERC grantee,    <a href="http://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/progcity/" target="_blank">wants to know</a>    how software can express a city’s life –    and how that life in turn is affected by the software: a virtuous, or vicious, feedback loop. For instance, can data    collected by the police get you arrested for a crime you haven’t yet committed?&nbsp;</p><p>This is called “predictive policing” – and it’s not science fiction:    New York City’s police commissioner recently called    it “the reality of today.” Based on perfectly reasonable evidence - neighbourhood crime statistics, social media connections,    for example - a person may seem statistically likely to commit a crime. With that information, the police or social workers can    be pro-active and offer help or warnings. &nbsp;The problem, says Kitchin, is that “you don’t have evidence that this person has    committed a crime … but you’re already treating them as a criminal.” And then what if the data get re-used by private companies?    &nbsp;“Whether you get a job or a tenancy, or a loan or a mortgage, may be made on the back of this data.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In another example Kitchin’s group has developed a cool app, the    <a href="http://www.dublindashboard.ie/pages/index" target="_blank"> Dublin Dashboard</a>, sharing virtually    all the publicly available sensor-readings    about the city. You can check the tides, temperature, shipping, river levels, oxygen and pollution levels, ambient noise, road traffic, parking spaces    – even available bike-shares. Camera feeds yield images. Maps break down city population by topics like gender and density. “And all the data is open,”    Kitchin says. “Everybody can go and build their own apps off this, or they can just look at it.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s obviously useful, and kind of fun. &nbsp;But there is a serious side too, Kitchin says. “How does that translate into new forms of governance?” Atlanta has a purpose-built dashboard room, where city government meets weekly to assess metrics. <a target="_blank" href="http://smartcitiescouncil.com/resources/ibm-helps-rio-become-smarter-city">Rio de Janeiro built an “urban operations centre” </a>with data streams from 30 government agencies, to try to manage the potential chaos of the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games happening there this year. Many cities have litter bins with sensors to signal when they’re full – meaning the garbage trucks can plot more efficient pick-up routes.&nbsp;</p><p>This information torrent is helpful to city managers, but does it really solve the problems people encounter in a city? It can lead managers, distracted by all the data, to focus on the wrong problems – what Kitchin calls “technological solutionism.” For instance, he says, with more data “you might be able to better manage homelessness, but you’re not going to stop people becoming homeless.”</p><img src="Uploads/Images/DublinDashboard2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin-top:15px"> <img src="Uploads/Images/DublinDashboard.png" style="width: 100%; margin-top:15px"></div>

                    <div class="text"><p>Traffic jams    are another unfortunate fact of city life.    <span style="font-weight: bold;">      Leclerq</span>     is <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/projects-and-results/erc-funded-projects/magnum">developing</a> a new way to look at them. He is Professor    of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.isttt.net/4-traffic-flow-theory/">Traffic Flow Theory at &nbsp;Lyon    University</a> – and if you’re wondering why such a post exists, in February 1980,    the Lyon-Paris Autoroute had one of the world’s longest recorded traffic jams - a full 175 kilometres - as thousands &nbsp;ended their Alpine ski holidays and headed    back towards the capital, all on the same day. </p><p>But consider    this case.&nbsp; Imagine a traveller from A to    B in a city can take either a bus or a car. Now, imagine you get some people to    switch from car to bus. There will be fewer cars on the road, so everybody – in    both cars and busses - moves a bit faster. Everyone wins. But the people who    selfishly refuse to switch to the bus win a bit more; their own route by car is    more direct and without time-wasting bus stops. So, in real life, few people    actually switch and the traffic remains horrible for all.</p><p>Most models    of this today look at flow, treating the traffic as if it were water and the    vehicles and people as though they were indistinguishable molecules in the    stream. “My idea is to focus more on trips” the individual trajectories, Leclerq    says. </p><p>He cites an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01001">MIT and Stanford                     study  </a>which used cellphone tracking, to show that    if you randomly eliminate 1 per cent of journeys, you reduce congestion by 3    per cent. But if you’re smarter about it, cancelling or delaying trips by 1 per    cent of drivers - but only in strategically chosen neighbourhoods - you can    reduce congestion by 18 per cent. It’s common sense: if the route between the    shops and the city hall is jammed, then focus traffic control on trips that    take that route. But few cities have that kind of smart traffic management.</p><p>Leclerq    hopes to speed things along, by finding general algorithms to determine which journeys    cause the most congestion in a system. He cites the old 80-20 rule: focus on    controlling the most troublesome 20 per cent of routes, to eliminate 80 per    cent of the problem. </p><p>That’s hard, of course: hard to identify the type of    travellers most clogging the roads, and harder still to get them to change    course or vehicle. But with good data and modelling, traffic planners might    “nudge” people to do the right thing for all – for instance, promise that if    you take the boring bus to work on the days when you aren’t in a rush, then for    the days when you have a can’t-be-late appointment you will get priority in the    transport system and zip ahead of others. This may sound like wishful thinking    now, but imagine how potent &nbsp;it could    become when driverless &nbsp;vehicles enter    the traffic mix, and their guidance systems connect to the city’s traffic    controllers.</p></div>

                        <p>In the annals of congestion, the epic standstill of Lyon-Paris in 1980 takes some beating. Cooped up commuters went bumper-to-bumper for 109 miles, thanks to an artery clogging combination of vacationers heading home and inclement weather.</p>

<p>Truly blood-boiling gridlock – but somehow not the worst ever. In Houston in 2005, mired motorists were trapped in their cars for 48 hours during a 100 mile-plus traffic.

                    <div class="text"><p>Another way
    to manage traffic is to make mass transit more appealing, by extending
    underground lines with more stations and trains. London, for instance, expects
    Underground traffic to soar to 230 million journeys a year from 136 million in
    2014, and is planning more line extensions to cope (read London's plan <a target="_blank" href="http://content.tfl.gov.uk/fit-for-the-future.pdf">here</a>). But digging tunnels in
    centuries-old cities isn’t easy. For starters, the tunnellers can damage the
    fragile old buildings above them. <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        Laefer</span> is trying to get around that problem. </p>



<p>The idea for
    her <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/projects-and-results/erc-stories/engineering-safer-cities" target="_blank">
    project</a> stemmed from a visit to the 9/11 wreckage in
    New York. “What I saw did not match some of the traditional blast literature” about
    how buildings collapse, she says. “I thought, wow, it would be good to have a
    3D model of this and do some of that blast modelling.” But good data for such
    models are hard to get.&nbsp; When London
    built the Jubilee Line in the 1990s, she says, it spent about half a billion
    pounds analysing and monitoring the tunnel route – yet still there was lots of
    damage to the buildings above, and lots of lawsuits. A key problem: the city’s
    architectural plans usually aren’t good enough to predict which buildings are
    weak and need underpinning. Of course, you could inspect the buildings in
    advance – but when Laefer tried that four years ago in Dublin, which is
    planning the first underground line for its tram system, just six of the 200
    owners contacted gave permission. </p>



<p>So now she
    takes to the sky, using helicopters – and soon drones – to survey buildings
    from above. They hang<span style="font-weight: bold;"> LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)</span>, sensors from the
    aircraft. This technology is often used in agricultural or forest surveys,
    pointing the cameras straight down from above; but with Laefer’s group the
    sensors fly low and swing like pendulums to see the buildings’ facades, rather
    than roofs. What kind of materials are the buildings made from? How big and
    numerous are the windows? (A building with lots of windows is usually more
    flexible.) How thick are the walls? It’s all in the sensor data. But it takes
    vast computing power to make sense of it all.</p>


<p>“My group is taking a complete data-driven
    approach,” she says. “What is there in the data? How do we reconstruct our
    urban environment from that?”</p></div>

                    <div class="text"><p>Indeed, city    models are now a major blue-sky research field around the world. That’s    important for urban planners, but is also of interest to video game developers,    the movie industry and others. <a href="http://www.sciencesquared.eu/network/researcher/luc.van-gool" target="_blank">Luc Van Gool,</a>    professor of computer visions at ETH-Zurich, is        <a href="http://www.varcity.eu/" target="_blank">trying</a> to find a better way to&nbsp; create these models. </p><p>His idea:    Most models use mathematical “point clouds” of data to represent buildings or    neighbourhoods – and then the computer manipulates them as you change or move    through the scene. But Van Gool works with images taken by a sort of Google    Street View-style mobile mapping van, adds in images of landmarks and the    torrent of information coming in from every website and traffic modelling app.    Then his system, still in development, will automatically analyse the images,    noting the number of storeys in a building, the shadows cast, the position of    traffic signs, the vegetation - and dynamically reconstruct that information to    create a living, three-dimensional model of the city.</p><p>“Everything is based on cheap sensors in    quantity,” he says. You can use it for animation, plotting travel routes,    virtually visiting Times Square or visualising the Eiffel Tower at night when    you’re there in the daytime. Van Gool is aiming for a model that’s fast, cheap    and uses real city data. “It’s no good having a 3D ghost town, when there’s    nothing alive inside,” he says.</p></div>

    installing phone-sniffing sensors on&nbsp; litter
    bins, in one week it collected data on 4 million phones and their owners, as
    they passed by the bins – and then it wanted to sell the data to advertisers
    and others. In the ensuing flap, the city banned it. But what other forms of
    privacy invasion go unremarked?</p>

    sensors monitoring the flow of people through every space on the Underground,
    on escalators, sensors increasingly in energy systems, sensors measuring air
    pollution, traffic flows, CCTV cameras,” Gabrys said “And a lot of the sensors
    and sensor systems are not necessarily going through processes where citizens
    are consulted or involved. That’s raised concerns about the extent to which
    people will be left out of those processes.” </p>


<p>She is
    trying to redress that balance in her ERC-funded 
        project
        ‘<a target="_blank" href="http://www.citizensense.net/">Citizen Sense</a>’, which is looking at smart-cities
    “sales pitches” by companies like Cisco, IBM, and Intel, investigating the
    degree to which the citizens themselves are involved in the planning, and trying
    to educate people about the sensors. So for example, the project holds walks
    through London to visit air quality monitoring stations and learn about
    pollutants and how they are monitored. The thinking is that if more citizens
    are aware of the sensors – especially on a public-health issue like air
    pollution – it might change how air-quality policy is developed. People would
    start to associate certain data with certain experiences: headaches, nausea,
    burning eyes, and so on. “The sensors became a way to create another kind of
    evidence [citizens] could point to that might be taken more seriously by
    regulators,” Gabrys says. </p>
        

<p>It’s all
    part of her general interest in how cities and their citizens interact as the
    cities become smarter. “It’s still an imagining of what the city could be
    like,” she says.</p></div>

                    <h3 class="title">Visiting the lab on your street corner</h3>
                    <div class="text"><p><a target="" href="http://www.sciencesquared.eu/network/researcher/matthew.gandy">    Matthew Gandy</a>, professor
    of geography at Cambridge University (formerly at University College London’s
    Urban Laboratory), would like to imagine a greener city. Green space is a major
    factor in how liveable a city feels. And <a target="_blank" href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/3/352">the degree of greenness        can vary hugely by city</a>: Birmingham, UK, has
    just 11 per cent of its area occupied by parks, trees and other green areas,
    while Stockholm has 39 per cent. </p>
        
        
<p>“I’m interested not just in the designed
    natures of the city - parks, gardens, tree-lined avenues and so on - but the
    spontaneous nature in cities. The extraordinary biodiversity you get in
    wastelands, or marginal spaces, has fascinated me for a long time,” Gandy says.</p>



<p>His
    ERC-funded  project
    , ‘<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/urbanlab/news/RethinkingUrbanNature">Rethinking Urban Nature (RUN)</a>’, aims to develop
    innovative methods for understanding how nature develops and thrives in our
    cities. In one of his focus cities, Berlin, he invited a botanist to come see a
    small plot of land used as a car park. “She was very enthusiastic to point out
    all of these different plants from all over the world,” he says. Not enough
    city-dwellers look at what’s on their doorstep, Gandy laments. “Too much
    contact with nature is at a distance,” on TV or the Internet. </p><p>That affects
    policy: people don’t speak up enough. “If we don’t get exciting debates about
    nature happening in cities, it’s really hard to think of how you can put
    together a global vision for the future of nature.”</p>



<p> So he looks
    at the green areas you don’t normally notice: the strips of land along
    railroads or canals, the spaces left by the wartime destruction in Europe, or
    the demilitarised space between North and South Korea and the former no-man’s
    land running around West Berlin. “With the fall of the Berlin Wall you had this
    interesting grid of abandoned security spaces that became interesting spaces of
    nature as well,” Gandy says. Compared with the monocultures of agricultural land
    and forestry plantations that ring cities, these wastelands are often far more
    unpredictable and interesting. “Every plot tells a story about the relationship
    between the city and its wider historic or global context.”</p>




<p> Through his
    eyes as a researcher, “Even the most mundane street corner becomes a scientific
    laboratory.”&nbsp;</p></div>
